#+TITLE:  ASR to Entities

Resource for the ASR n-best transcriptions to entity parsing problem. More
details to be written later. Check the data file ~items.json~ for examples of date
and time entity situations from an old deployment. Each example represents an
utterance in a tuple with following 3 items:

1. Utterance transcriptions and some other input that goes in the SLU system.
2. Prediction from the system that ran during the call.
3. Human annotation based on tog format.
